### Getting started

To run the site locally, you'll want to clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/watsi/meso-site
cd meso-site
npm install
```

You can start the local webserver by running:

```bash
npm start
```

### Deployment

This site is built as a set of static files and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). Currently, there's only a production environment, [`meso-health`](https://app.netlify.com/sites/meso-health/overview), since changes can easily be previewed locally.
